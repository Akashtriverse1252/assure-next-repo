      "question": "What are allergies?",
      "answer": "<p>Allergies occur when the body responds to a foreign protein. Usually, these proteins, known as allergens, are not harmful.</p><p>Allergies can be different for everyone. Some people might just feel a bit uncomfortable, while others could have a really serious emergency called anaphylaxis, which needs quick attention.</p>"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is an allergic reaction?",
      "answer": "<p>An allergic reaction is the way the body responds to an allergen. When someone has allergies, the first time they encounter a specific allergen, their body responds by making immunoglobulin E (IgE). The immune system creates antibodies, and these antibodies form IgE in response to the allergen.</p>"
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the causes of allergies?",
      "answer": "<p>Allergies begin when the body's immune system confuses a harmless substance with a foreign invader. If the person is exposed to the allergen again, these antibodies release various immune system chemicals, like histamine that causes allergy symptoms.</p><p><strong>Common allergies triggers include:</strong></p><ul><li>Airborne allergens, such as pollen, animal dander, dust mites, and mold.</li><li>Certain foods, like peanuts, tree nuts, wheat, soy, fish, shellfish, eggs, and milk.</li><li>Insect stings, such as from a bee or wasp.</li><li>Medications, particularly penicillin or penicillin-based antibiotics.</li><li>Latex or other substances which can cause allergic skin reactions.</li></ul>"

    {
      "question": "How are allergies diagnosed?",
      "answer": "<p>Allergies are often diagnosed through a combination of medical history, physical examination, and allergy testing. Skin tests or blood tests may be conducted to identify specific allergens.</p>"
    },
    {
      "question": "What tests are done to diagnose allergies?",
      "answer": "<p>There are two major types of allergy tests:</p><p><strong>1. Skin Allergy Tests</strong></p><p><strong>Skin prick test:</strong> This is also known as the scratch test, where the suspected allergen is placed on the back or forearm, and the site is pricked so that the allergen enters the body system. The doctor then observes the skin area closely for any reactions. The test is done for multiple suspected allergens at once. In such cases, the procedure is carried out on multiple skin points using the different suspected allergens. </br> </br>It is important to note that this test isn’t solely for testing skin allergies. If one suspects a food allergy, a skin prick test can also be used for food allergy testing. The doctor introduces a liquid that contains protein from the suspected food into the body through a prick. If one is allergic to food, there will be reactions at the test site.</p><p><strong>Intradermal test:</strong> In the intradermal test, doctors inject a small amount of the suspected allergen just under the skin, and the skin surface is observed for a few minutes for reactions. Intradermal injections are mainly administered on the forearm, upper arm, or back. A positive test will result in swelling, redness, or an itch. This test is mainly used for testing penicillin and insect bite allergies.</p><p><strong>Patch test:</strong> A patch test is another method of allergy testing involving the skin that is effective in identifying the causes of the allergy. It does not involve needles. Instead, a patch embedded with several suspected allergens is attached to the skin. The person is required to wear the patch for up to 48 hours, and during this time it is suggested to avoid bathing or activities that will make a person sweat.</p><p><strong>2. Blood (IgE) Test</strong></p><p>This test is often used along with skin allergy tests to confirm or further understand your allergens. It involves sending a sample of your blood to a lab. The laboratory introduces allergens into the blood sample and assesses the levels of immunoglobulin E (IgE), an antibody associated with allergic reactions. A total IgE test quantifies the overall quantity of IgE antibodies present. On the other hand, a specific IgE test gauges the amount of IgE produced by the body in response to a particular allergen.</p>"

      "question": "What tests are done to diagnose liver disease?",
      "answer": " <p>Typically, liver disease is diagnosed using a group of tests that are performed together to detect, evaluate, and monitor liver disease or damage. The panel usually consists of several tests that are run at the same time on a blood sample. These include:</p><ul><li><strong>Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT):</strong> An enzyme found mainly in liver tissue and to a lesser extent in the heart, kidney, and skeletal muscle. Its measurement is clinically useful in the diagnosis of liver and biliary disease.</li><li><strong>Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST):</strong> An enzyme found in several parts of the body, including the heart, liver, and muscles. Since AST levels aren't as specific for liver damage as ALT, it's usually measured together with ALT to check for liver problems. When the liver is damaged, AST can be released into the bloodstream. A high result on an AST test might indicate a problem with the liver or muscles.</li><li><strong>Gamma Glutamyl Transpeptidase (GGTP):</strong> An enzyme found in many organs throughout the body, with the highest concentrations found in the liver. GGT is elevated in the blood in most diseases that cause damage to the liver or bile ducts.</li><li><strong>Bilirubin, Total:</strong> Used to detect an increased level of bilirubin in the blood. It helps determine the cause of jaundice and diagnose conditions such as liver disease, haemolytic anaemia, and blockage of the bile ducts.</li><li><strong>Bilirubin, Direct:</strong> Measures a form of bilirubin that is conjugated (combined with another compound) in the liver; it is only increased in the case of liver disease.</li><li><strong>Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP):</strong> An enzyme related to the bile ducts but also produced by the bones, intestines, and during pregnancy by the placenta (after birth). High levels of ALP may indicate liver inflammation, blockage of the bile ducts, or bone disease.</li><li><strong>Albumin:</strong> Albumin is the main protein made by the liver. This test measures the level of albumin in the blood. A low result indicates that the liver isn’t functioning properly.</li><li><strong>Total Protein:</strong> The total protein test measures the total amount of protein in the blood and specifically looks for the amount of albumin and globulin. It also measures the ratio of albumin to globulin in the blood known as the A/G ratio. Total protein is useful in evaluating patients for nutritional status, liver disease, and protein-losing renal and gastrointestinal diseases.</li><li><strong>Ammonia Test:</strong> Used to detect an elevated level of ammonia in the blood that may be caused by severe liver disease, kidney failure, or certain rare genetic disorders.</li><li><strong>Ceruloplasmin Test:</strong> Ceruloplasmin is the major copper-carrying protein in the blood and also plays a role in iron metabolism. Ceruloplasmin testing is used to help diagnose Wilson disease, an autosomal recessive disorder.</li><li><strong>Bile Acids, Total:</strong> Increases in serum bile acids may be a marker for acute hepatitis, chronic hepatitis, liver sclerosis, liver cancer, and intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy.</li><li><strong>NAFLD (Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease) Fibrosis Score:</strong> It is a non-invasive scoring system based on several laboratory tests that help estimate the amount of scarring in the liver.</li></ul>"
